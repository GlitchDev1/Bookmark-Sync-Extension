# Firefox Bookmark Sync Extension

This extension will be able to sync your Firefox Bookmark Folders on GitHub, so you can decide which folders to sync and which not to.

For styling I try to come as close to the firefox dark theme as possible. I reused the common-shared stylesheet I found in the settings page.

This is my first ever browser extension, so please tell me about errors I possibly made:)



The plan will be to make the user enter a access token and also a repository to push to. Then the extension will simply push if a new bookmark was added to a synced folder.
