# Firefox Bookmark Sync Extension

This extension will be able to sync your Firefox Bookmark Folders on GitHub, so you can decide which folders to sync and which not to.

For styling I try to come as close to the firefox dark theme as possible. I reused the common-shared stylesheet I found in the settings page.

This is my first ever browser extension, so please tell me about errors I possibly made:)
